        <p> Paradise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the 17th-century English poet John Milton (1608–1674). The
            first<br>
            version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition
            followed
            in
            1674, s arranged into twelve book(in the manner of Virgil's Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout.[1][2] It
            is
            considered to be Milton's masterpiece, and it helped solidify his reputation as one of the greatest English
            poets
            of
            all time.[3] The poem concerns the biblical story of the fall of man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the
            fallen
            angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
