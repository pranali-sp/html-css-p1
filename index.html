                <blockquote>
                    <dd>It looks like you're asking about someone named Prayrit Singh. 
                        Could you clarify who you're referring to? There are several
                         people with this name, and without more context, it's hard 
                         to determine if you're asking about a public figure, a 
                         professional, or someone else.

                        "Jane Smith" is a very common name, so it could refer to many 
                        different people across various contexts. If you're referring 
                        to a specific person named Jane Smith, it would be helpful to 
                        have more contextâ€”whether she is a public figure, a professional 
                        in a certain field, or someone involved with a particular organization, 
                        such as Coding Ninjas, academia, or a business.
